### Advanced Mute System (early version of Improved Mute Manager)

Internal module Advanced Mute System for Sven Co-op (injectable), what's the idea of this mod? Basically, when you mute one player the game magically mutes multiple of them, so it was fixed by this mod. Didn't I say that Sven Devs are fking braindead retards?
