### Auto Vote

Internal module Auto Vote for Sven Co-op, automatically votes (Yes or No) when a vote menu appears to prevent this window from blocking our camera when we're walking / bunnyhopping. 
Let's admit, Sven Co-op's DevTeam are fcking degenerates, who the fck in their right mind would make a voting menu that blocks your camera??? F8cking dckheads
