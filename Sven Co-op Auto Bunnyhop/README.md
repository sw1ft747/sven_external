### Auto Bunnyhop

External Auto Bunnyhop for Sven Co-op, was used by me and friends since 5.22 up to 5.24 until the 5.25 update has been released, then I just added autojump to early build of SvenInt.

Last update to version 5.24
Approximate creation time: November 20, 2020

This is actually a clone of L4D2's Auto Bunnyhop project, so the idea of making external Auto Bunnyhop for L4D2 forced me to try the same on Sven Co-op and that's the only reason I came back to Sven in November 2020 when I quit it in August of the same year. However, after GLOM did shutdown his server, I have not idea what would've happened to the Half-Life anarchy player base if I hadn't returned to Sven and carried the successor server (Half-Life A) on my back, sooo bless C++ for forcing me to learn it!!
