### Input Manager (Color Pulsator)

Internal module Input Manager (Color Pulsator) for Sven Co-op, repeats sequence of pressed keyboard buttons with given interval in milliseconds, actually it should be named Color Pulsator, since the main idea of the project was to change the color of player's model (mostly, the goose model) every X seconds/milliseconds from red to blue and repeat it, so it's just the early version of SvenInt's Color Pulsator
