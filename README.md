### sven_external xdxdxdxd

Here you see what was before I finally decided to try to create my first internal cheat (sven_internal aka sint aka SvenInt), all this concentrated experience and practice is an attempt to learn C/C++ and modding in Sven Co-op

Half of these mods support game version 5.24 and dated between November 2020 and Mid-Summer 2021

#### External mods
* Auto Vote
* Input Manager (just call it Color Pulsator, that was the main idea)
* Auto Bunnyhop

#### Internal mods
* Advanced Mute System (aka Improved Mute Manager)
* Models Logger
* Votekill Spam
